# Common .NET MAUI Memory Leaks and Their Fixes

This repository contains common patterns that cause memory leaks in .NET MAUI applications. Each problematic pattern is implemented in a separate page so that you can test it separatelly. 

Pages in this project include code that resolves a memory leak. You can uncomment this code to compare the behavior of the application with and without memory leak.

To check if a page persists in the memory, click the "sdfsdf" button that invokes the garbage collector and calculates the number alive pages.

You may need to click the "sdfsdf" button 2-3 times to force the garbage collector destroys unused objects in multiple cycles. 

Below are the usage scenarios causing an object to stay in the memory:

1. Reference from a long-living object or static property
2. Event handler referenced by a long-living object
3. Delegate funnction  referenced by a long-living object
4. Control with an internal memory leak on a page
5. Singleton view registered in a dependency injection container

You can use .NET Meteor and Heapview to profile your .NET MAUI application. Refer to the following blog post for additional information: [.NET MAUI Memory Profiling - Identify and Fix Memory Leaks](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/mobile/archive/2024/08/21/net-maui-memory-profiling-identify-and-fix-memory-leaks.aspx)
